An ID that can match a block, such as the literals ``"earliest"``, ``"latest"``, or ``"pending"``

An ID representing a point in time on a blockchain, as used in the

:meth:`~ape.managers.chain.ChainManager.snapshot` methods. Can be a ``str``, ``int``, or ``bytes``.
Providers will expect and handle snapshot IDs differently. There shouldn't be a need to change
providers when using this feature, so there should not be confusion over this type in practical use
cases.
