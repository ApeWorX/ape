BlockID = Union[int, HexStr, HexBytes, Literal["earliest", "latest", "pending"]]
"""
An ID that can match a block, such as the literals ``"earliest"``, ``"latest"``, or ``"pending"``
as well as a block number or hash (HexBytes).
"""

ContractCode = Union[str, bytes, HexBytes]
"""
A type that represents contract code, which can be represented in string, bytes, or HexBytes.
"""

SnapshotID = Union[str, int, bytes]
"""
An ID representing a point in time on a blockchain, as used in the
:meth:`~ape.managers.chain.ChainManager.snapshot` and
:meth:`~ape.managers.chain.ChainManager.snapshot` methods. Can be a ``str``, ``int``, or ``bytes``.
Providers will expect and handle snapshot IDs differently. There shouldn't be a need to change
providers when using this feature, so there should not be confusion over this type in practical use
cases.
