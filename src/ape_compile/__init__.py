    Set to ``True`` to compile dependencies during ``ape compile``.
    Generally, dependencies are not compiled during ``ape compile``
    This is because dependencies may not compile in Ape on their own,
    but you can still reference them in your project's contracts' imports.
    Some projects may be more dependency-based and wish to have the
    contract types always compiled during ``ape compile``, and these projects
    should configure ``include_dependencies`` to be ``True``.
