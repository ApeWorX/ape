# Developing Projects with Ape

Use `ape` to create blockchain projects. A common project structure looks like this:

```
project              # The root project directory
├── contracts/       # Project source files, such as '.sol' or '.vy' files
├── tests/           # Project tests, ran using the 'ape test' command
├── scripts/         # Project scripts, such as deploy scripts, ran using the 'ape run <name>' command
└── ape-config.yaml  # The ape project configuration file
```

See the [Configuration guide](config.md) for a more detailed explanation of settings you can
use in your `ape-config.yaml` files.

## Compiling Contracts

The project manager object is a representation of your current project. Access it from the root `ape` namespace:

```python
from ape import project
```

Your `project` contains all the "relevant" files, such as source files in the `contracts/` directory. The
`contracts/` directory is where compilers look for contracts to compile. File extensions found within the `contracts/`
directory determine which compiler plugin `ape` uses. Make sure to install the compiler plugins you need if they are
missing by adding them to your `ape-config.yaml`'s `plugin` section, or manually adding via the following:

```bash
ape plugins install solidity vyper
```

Then, use the following command to compile all contracts in the `contracts/` directory:

```bash
ape compile
```

**NOTE**: Compiler plugins download missing compiler version binaries, based on the contracts' pragma-spec.

The contract containers are then accessible from the `project` manager; deploy them in the `console` or in scripts:

```python
from ape import accounts, project

account = accounts.load("my_account_alias")
account.deploy(project.MyContract)
```

**NOTE**: You can also deploy contracts from the container itself:

```python
from ape import accounts, project

account = accounts.load("my_account_alias")
project.MyContract.deploy(sender=account)
```

### Dependencies

To set up dependencies in your ``ape-config.yaml`` file, follow [this guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/config.html#dependencies).
If you are using dependencies from a remote source, they will download when you run `ape compile` or other commands that compile beforehand.
Dependencies only need to download and compile once.

You can access dependency contracts off your root project manager:

```python
from ape import accounts, project

dependency_contract = project.dependencies["my_dependency"].DependencyContractType
my_account = accounts.load("alias")
deployed_contract = my_account.deploy(dependency_contract, "argument")
print(deployed_contract.address)
```

## Networks

The default provider for the development network is the
[Ethereum Tester provider](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-testers). However, you can change the default provider per
network using the `ape-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
ethereum:
  development:
    default_provider: hardhat
```

For specifying the network in an ad-hoc fashion, commands such as `run`, `test`, and `console` offer a `--network`
option:

```bash
ape console --network ethereum:local:hardhat
```

**NOTE**: If you are using the default ecosystem or network, you can omit them from the option:

```bash
ape console --network ::hardhat
```

## Scripts

You can write scripts that run using the `ape run` command. The `ape run` command will register and run Python
files defined under the `scripts/` directory that do not start with an `_` underscore. If the scripts take
advantage of utilities from our [`ape.cli`](../methoddocs/cli.html#ape-cli) submodule,
you can build a [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) command line interface
by defining a `click.Command` or `click.Group` object called `cli` in your file.
Otherwise, if the script has a `main()` method, it will execute that method when called.

Note that by default, `cli` scripts do not have
[`ape.cli.network_option`](../methoddocs/cli.html?highlight=options#ape.cli.options.network_option)
installed, giving you more flexibility in how you define your scripts.
`main` scripts will always provide a network option to the call.

## Testing

You can test your project using the `ape test` command. The `ape test` command comes with the core-plugin `ape-test`.
The `ape-test` plugin extends the popular python testing framework
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/contents.html).

### Test Structure

Tests must be located in a project's `tests/` directory. Each test file must start with `test_` and have the `.py`
extension, such as `test_my_contract.py`. Each test method within the file must also start with `test_`. The following
is an example test:

```python
def test_add():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

### Fixtures

Fixtures are any type of re-usable instances of something with configurable scopes. `pytest` handles passing fixtures
into each test method as test-time. You can define your own fixtures or use existing ones. The `ape-test` plugin comes
with fixtures you will likely want to use:

#### accounts fixture

You have access to test accounts. These accounts are automatically funded, and you can use them to transact in your
tests. Access each [test account](../methoddocs/api.html?highlight=testaccount#ape.api.accounts.TestAccountAPI) by
index from the `accounts` fixture:

```python
def test_my_method(accounts):
    owner = accounts[0]
    other = accounts[1]
```

For code readability and sustainability, create your own fixtures using the `accounts` fixture:

```python
import pytest


@pytest.fixture
def owner(accounts):
    return accounts[0]


@pytest.fixture
def other(accounts):
    return accounts[1]


def test_my_method(owner, other):
    ...
```

You can configure your accounts by changing the `mnemonic` or `number_of_accounts` settings in the `test` section of
your `ape-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
test:
  mnemonic: test test test test test test test test test test test junk
  number_of_accounts: 5
```

If you are using a fork-provider, such as [Hardhat](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape-hardhat), you can use impersonated accounts by accessing random addresses off the fixture:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def vitalik(accounts):
    return accounts["0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b"]
```

#### project fixture

You also have access to the `project` you are testing. You will need this to deploy your contracts in your tests.

```python
import pytest


@pytest.fixture
def owner(accounts):
    return accounts[0]


@pytest.fixture
def my_contract(project, owner):
    # ^ use the 'project' fixture from the 'ape-test' plugin
    return owner.deploy(project.MyContract)
```

### Test Pattern

Tests are generally divisible into three parts:

1. Set-up
2. Invocation
3. Assertion

In the example above, we created a fixture that deploys our smart-contract. This is an example of a 'setup' phase.
Next, we need to call a method on our contract. Let's assume there is a method called `is_owner()` that returns `True`
when it is the owner of the contract making the transaction.

This is an example of how that test may look:

```python
def test_is_owner(my_contract, owner, other):
    owner_is_owner = my_contract.foo(sender=owner)
    assert owner_is_owner

    other_is_owner = my_contract.foo(sender=other)
    assert not other_is_owner
```

### Test Providers

Out-of-the-box, your tests run using the `eth-tester` provider, which comes bundled with ape. If you have `geth`
installed, you can use the `ape-geth` plugin that also comes with ape.

```bash
ape test --network ethereum:local:geth
```

Each testing plugin should work the same way. You will have access to the same test accounts.

Another option for testing providers is the [ape-hardhat plugin](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape-hardhat), which does
not come with `ape` but can be installed by including it in the `plugins` list in your `ape-config.yaml` file or
manually installing it using the command:

```bash
ape plugins install hardhat
```

### Test Interactive

Use ape test ``-I`` to open the interactive mode at the point of exception. This allows the user to inspect the point of failure in your tests.
