# Networks

When interacting with the blockchain, you will have to select a network.

## Selecting a Network

Commonly, you will use the `--network` option to configure your network during Ape commands.
The following is a list of common Ape commands that can use the `--network` option:

```bash
ape test --network ethereum:local:foundry
ape console --network arbitrum:testnet:alchemy
```

You can also use the `--network` option on scripts that use the `main()` method approach or scripts that implement that `ConnectedProviderCommand` command type.
See [the scripting guide](./scripts.html) to learn more about scripts and how to add the network option.

**NOTE**: You can omit values to use defaults.
For example, the default ecosystem is `ethereum` and the default network is `local`, so you can do:

```bash
ape run --network ::foundry
```

as a short-cut for `ethereum:local:foundry`.

## Configuring Networks

Change network defaults using your project's `ape-config.yaml` file.
The following configuration changes the default ecosystem, network, and provider such that if you omitted the `--network` option on connected-provider commands, it would use the value `<ecosystem-name>:<network-name>:<provider-name>`.

```yaml
default_ecosystem: <ecosystem-name>

<ecosystem-name>:
  default_network: <network-name>
  <network-name>:
    default_provider: <provider-name>
```

You may also configure a specific gas limit for a given network:

```yaml
<ecosystem-name>:
  default_network: <network-name>
  <network-name>:
    gas_limit: "max"
```

You may use one of:

- `"auto"` - gas limit is estimated for each transaction
- `"max"` - the maximum block gas limit is used
- A number or numeric string, base 10 or 16 (e.g. `1234`, `"1234"`, `0x1234`, `"0x1234"`)

For the local network configuration, the default is `"max"`. Otherwise, it is `"auto"`.

## Local Network

The default network in Ape is the local network (keyword `"local"`).
It is meant for running tests and debugging contracts.
Out-of-the-box, Ape ships with two development providers you can use for the `local` network:

- [EthTester](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-tester)
- An Ephemeral Geth process

```bash
ape test --network ::test
ape test --network ::geth  # Launch a local development geth process
```

To learn more about testing in ape, follow [this guide](./testing.html).

## Live Networks

Use the core plugin `ape-geth` to connect to local or remote nodes via URI.
The geth plugin is abstract in that it represents any node, not just geth nodes.
However, it will work best when connected to a geth node.
To configure network URIs in geth, you can use the `ape-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
geth:
  ethereum:
    mainnet:
      uri: https://foo.node.bar
```

## Custom Network Connection

If you would like to connect to a URI using the default Ethereum node provider, you can specify a URI for the provider name in the `--network` option:

```bash
ape run script --network ethereum:mainnet:https://foo.bar
```

Additionally, if you want to connect to an unknown ecosystem or network, you can use the URI by itself.
However, this is not recommended.

```bash
ape run script --network https://foo.bar
```

**WARNING**: The recommended approach is to find or build a plugin to have more native support.
Some reasons for this include:

1. You may need to integrate with other plugins, such as explorer plugins for getting contract types.
2. Some chains may not implement EIP-1559 or may have forked from a specific configuration.
3. Response differences in uncommon blocks, such as the `"pending"` block or the genesis block.
4. Revert messages and exception-handling differences.
5. You are limited to using `web3.py` and EVM-based chains.

## Running a Network Process

To run a network with a process, use the `ape networks run` command:

```shell
ape networks run
```

By default, `ape networks run` runs a development Geth process.
To use a different network, such as `hardhat` or Anvil nodes, use the `--network` flag:

```shell
ape networks run --network ethereum:local:foundry
```

## Provider Interaction

Once you are connected to a network, you now have access to a `.provider`.
The provider class is what higher level Manager classes in Ape use to interface with the blockchain.
You can call methods directly from the provider, like this:

```python
from ape import chain

block = chain.provider.get_block("latest")
```

## Provider Context Manager

Use the [ProviderContextManager](../methoddocs/api.html#ape.api.networks.ProviderContextManager) to change the network-context in Python.
When entering a network for the first time, it will connect to that network.
**You do not need to call `.connect()` or `.disconnect()` manually**.

For example, if you are using a script with a default network connection, you can change connection in the middle of the script by using the provider context manager:

```python
from ape import chain, networks

def main():
    start_provider = chain.provider.name
    with networks.ethereum.mainnet.use_provider("geth") as provider:
        # We are using a different provider than the one we started with.
        assert start_provider != provider.name
```

Jump between networks to simulate multi-chain behavior.

```python
import click
from ape import networks

@click.command()
def cli():
    with networks.polygon.mainnet.use_provider("geth"):
        ...
    with networks.ethereum.mainnet.use_provider("geth"):
        ...
```

The argument to [use_provider()](../methoddocs/api.html#ape.api.networks.NetworkAPI.use_provider) is the name of the provider you want to use.
You can also tell Ape to use the default provider by calling method [use_default_provider()](../methoddocs/api.html#ape.api.networks.NetworkAPI.use_default_provider) instead.
This will use whatever provider is set as default for your ecosystem / network combination (via one of your `ape-config.yaml` files).

For example, let's say I have a default provider set like this:

```yaml
arbitrum:
  mainnet:
    default_provider: alchemy
```

```python
import ape

# Use the provider configured as the default for the arbitrum::mainnet network.
# In this case, it will use the "alchemy" provider.
with ape.networks.arbitrum.mainnet.use_default_provider():
    ...
```

You can also use the [parse_network_choice()](../methoddocs/managers.html#ape.managers.networks.NetworkManager.parse_network_choice) method when working with network choice strings:

```python
from ape import networks

# Same as doing `networks.ethereum.local.use_provider("test")`.
with networks.parse_network_choice("ethereum:local:test") as provider:
    print(provider)
```

**A note about disconnect**: Providers do not disconnect until the very end of your Python session.
This is so you can easily switch network contexts in a bridge or multi-chain environment, which happens in fixtures and other sessions out of Ape's control.
However, sometimes you may definitely want your temporary network session to end before continuing, in which case you can use the `disconnect_after=True` kwarg:

```python
from ape import networks

with networks.parse_network_choice("ethereum:local:foundry", disconnect_after=True) as provider:
    print(provider)
```

### Forked Context

Using the `networks.fork()` method, you can achieve similar effects to using a forked network with `disconnect_after=True`.
For example, let's say we are running the following script on the network `ethereum:mainnet`.
We can switch to a forked network by doing this:

```python
from ape import networks

def main():
    with networks.fork("foundry"):
        ...
        # Do stuff on a local, forked version of mainnet

    # Switch back to mainnet.
```
